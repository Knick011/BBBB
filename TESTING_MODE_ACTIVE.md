# ⚠️ TESTING MODE ACTIVE

**ALL ADMOB IDS HAVE BEEN SWITCHED TO TEST IDS FOR SAFE TESTING**

## Changes Made:

### 1. AdMobService.ts
- ✅ Switched to TestIds.BANNER
- ✅ Switched to TestIds.REWARDED  
- ✅ Switched to TestIds.INTERSTITIAL
- ✅ Switched to TestIds.APP_ID

### 2. AndroidManifest.xml
- ✅ Changed App ID to Google's test app ID: `ca-app-pub-3940256099942544~3347511713`

### 3. BannerAdComponent.tsx
- ✅ Using TestIds.BANNER instead of production ID

### 4. RewardedAdService.ts
- ✅ Using TestIds.REWARDED instead of production ID

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Before Play Store Release

**YOU MUST REVERT THESE CHANGES** and restore production IDs:

1. **AdMobService.ts**: Restore `ca-app-pub-7353957756801275~5242496423`
2. **AndroidManifest.xml**: Restore `ca-app-pub-7353957756801275~5242496423`
3. **BannerAdComponent.tsx**: Restore `ca-app-pub-7353957756801275/3370462815`
4. **RewardedAdService.ts**: Restore `ca-app-pub-7353957756801275/3777656920`

## Why This Was Done:
- Using production ad IDs during testing/development can get your AdMob account suspended
- Test IDs are safe and won't generate real ad revenue
- Google requires test IDs during development phase

**Current Status**: ✅ SAFE FOR TESTING - No risk of AdMob policy violations
